# Astromony-programing
* compilation of INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMY PROGRAMING PROBLEMBS
 i guess that would be helpful for future generation :)
so there would be and instruction how to start and also you can join and send solved problems here
# HOW TO START
what you need 
* python *(use IDE(vc;pycharm) that you whant or just visit https://python.org )
  * **from** *matplotlib* *pandas* *numpy* if you want *seaborn* **import** *
* visit (https://stepik.org/) or other free learning platforms as github))) youtube you name it
* after come back there and learn
  ## ATENTION ipynb NOT py

# HOW TO "PRESENT"(no idea how to name it) YOUR PROBLEMS (TEX USAGE)
* 1) find your problem that you want to solve and... solve it )
* 2) On the JUPYTER tab, click Download as -> Latex (.tex) and download the zip file
   * also you can use  google colab(https://colab.research.google.com)
* 3) On the Overleaf tab, click New Project -> Upload Project and add a zip file 
* 4) To the file .tex add the babel package with the English, Russian(ur lang) parameters with the second line so that Russian letters are displayed.
    
* https://simpletex.net/ai/latex_ocr for handwriten formulas in TEX
* After that, everything should work, the report can be further processed in OVERLEAF, add the name and number of the task, formulas, explanations, etc.
* if you use "%matplotlib notebook" if there are interactive graphs in notepad, then the pictures are not exported at all and instead of a file .zip is downloaded as a regular .tex (So it's better not to use (interactive graphs in the task report are quite strange ...), and if something you need is not displayed in the picture, copy the original picture from notepad by rightâ€”clicking on it and add it to the project under the same name)
